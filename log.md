### Day 0 - July 5, 2018
Today, I learned about [#100DaysofMLCode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuQMBj1cWPo) from Siraj Raval. Since I learned about the challenge two hours before midnight, 
I decided to pick a problem for today. 

I have narrowed down the problem to personal health management. 

### Day 1 - July 6, 2018
I spent 2 hours learning with my Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree program. As far as my project is concerned, I think it would involve image processing and personal health management. 

I am still not clear on my project. 

### Day 2

I spent the day learning OpenCV especially image filtering and edge detection techniques. This is the first time I spent a significant part of the day on learning something in a long time.
